\arguments{
\item{suffStat}{A data.frame with \eqn{(p+1)} columns, the first of which is
the factor G (genotype, i.e samples' IDs) and subsequent columns contain
the traits, and optionally some QTLs. The name of the first column should
be G. Should not contain covariates.}

\item{QTLs}{Column numbers in \code{suffStat} that correspond to QTLs. These
may be partly in \eqn{S} and \eqn{x} and \eqn{y}, but \eqn{x} and \eqn{y}
cannot be both QTLs. Note: the factor genotype (column number 1) may occur
in S, as well as x and y}

\item{K}{The kinship (i.e genetic relatedness matrix). It's a marker-based
relatedness (kinship) matrix of dimension \eqn{n x n}, \eqn{n} being the
number of unique genotypes in the first column in \code{suffStat}. If
\code{suffStat} contains replicates, this argument should be set to
\code{NULL} (the default). If \code{NULL} (the default), independent
genetic effects are assumed. In case of replicates, the resulting
relatedness of the observations will be \eqn{Z K Z^t}, where \eqn{Z} is the
incidence matrix assigning plants to genotypes.}

\item{replicates}{Logical. Set to \code{TRUE} if your data (experimental
design) is balanced, and there are replicates. In this case, MANOVA will
set starting values for fitting and the kinship matrix \code{K} should not
be provided. If there are no replicates (unique genotypes), set
\code{replicates = FALSE} and provide the kinship matrix \code{K}
parameter. Default is \code{TRUE}}

\item{use.manova}{Set to \code{TRUE} to let MANOVA set starting values for
fitting (Default). This is only valid if your experimental design is
balanced, and there are replicates. If there are no replicates, this
parameter set to \code{FALSE} and the kinship matrix, \code{K}, should be
supplied}

\item{alpha}{The significance level used in each conditional independence
test. Default is 0.01. The test itself of course does not depend on this,
but it is used in the EM-algorithm to speed up calculations. More
precisely, the EM-algorithm is stopped once the P value is below the
significance level. This can be done because the PC algorithm only needs an
accept/ reject decision.}

\item{labels}{(optional) character vector of variable (or
    \dQuote{node}) names.  Typically preferred to specifying \code{p}.}

\item{p}{(optional) number of variables (or nodes).  May be specified
    if \code{labels} are not, in which case \code{labels} is set to
    \code{1:p}.}

\item{m.max}{Maximum size of the conditioning sets.}

\item{fixedGaps}{A logical matrix of dimension \eqn{(p+1) \times (p+1)},
where \eqn{p} is the number of traits. The first row and column refer to
the genotype node G, and subsequent rows and columns to the traits. As in
the pcalg package, the edge \eqn{[i - j]} is removed before starting the
algorithm if the entry \eqn{[i, j]} or \eqn{[j, i]} (or both) are
\code{TRUE}. In that case, the edge is guaranteed to be absent in the
resulting graph.}

\item{fixedEdges}{A logical matrix of dimension \eqn{(p+1) \times (p+1)},
where \eqn{p} is the number of traits. The first row and column refer to
the genotype node \code{G}, and subsequent rows and columns to the traits.
As in the \code{pcalg} package, the edge \eqn{[i - j]} is never considered
for removal if the entry \eqn{[i, j]} or \eqn{[j, i]} (or both) are
\code{TRUE}. In that case, the edge is guaranteed to be present in the
resulting graph.}

\item{NAdelete}{Logical, and is the NAdelete option in pcalg::pc function:
TRUE deletes the edge corresponding to the conditional independence test
when it returns NA. Default is FALSE}

\item{covariates}{A data.frame containing covariates that should always be
used in each conditional independence test. Should be either \code{NULL}
(default) or a data.frame with the same number of rows as \code{suffStat}.
An intercept is already included for each trait in suffStat; covariates
should not contain a column of ones.}

\item{max.iter}{Maximum number of iterations in the EM-algorithm, used to fit
the bivariate mixed model (when \code{use.res = FALSE)}.}

\item{use.res}{If \code{TRUE}, the test for conditional independence of 2
traits given a set of other traits and \eqn{G} is based on residuals from
GBLUP. If \code{FALSE} (the default), it is based on bivariate mixed
models.}

\item{res.cor}{If \code{use.res = TRUE}, \code{res.cor} should be the
correlation matrix of the residuals of the GBLUP- the residuals can be
obtained using the \code{getResiduals} function. If \code{res.cor} is
provided, it is based on partial correlations among the residuals, tested
using the gaussCItest function from pcalg. In case \code{res.cor} is
\code{NULL} (the default), the test for conditional independence between Yj
and Yk given a set of traits YS is based on a bivariate mixed model.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, p-values for the conditional independence
tests are printed}

\item{stop.if.significant}{If \code{TRUE}, the EM-algorithm used in some of
the conditional independence tests (when \code{use.res = FALSE}) will be
stopped whenever the p-value becomes significant, i.e. below \code{alpha}.
This will speed up calculations, and can be done because (1) the PC
algorithm only needs an accept/reject decision (2) In EM the likelihood is
nondecreasing. Should be put to \code{FALSE} if the precise p-values are of
interest.}

The inferred skeleton is order-independent (equivalent to pcalg::skeleton
with skel.method = "stable") following the “PC-stable” approach proposed by
Colombo and Maathuis (2014).
