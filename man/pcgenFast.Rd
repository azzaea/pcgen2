\usage{
pcgenFast(
  suffStat,
  alpha = 0.01,
  m.max = Inf,
  res.m.max = Inf,
  verbose = FALSE,
  covariates = NULL,
  fixedEdges = NULL,
  QTLs = integer(),
  max.iter = 50,
  stop.if.significant = TRUE,
  cov.method = "uni",
  use.res = FALSE,
  return.pvalues = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{suffStat}{A data.frame with \eqn{(p+1)} columns, the first of which is
the factor G (genotype, i.e samples' IDs) and subsequent columns contain
the traits, and optionally some QTLs. The name of the first column should
be G. Should not contain covariates.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level used in each conditional independence
test. Default is 0.01. The test itself of course does not depend on this,
but it is used in the EM-algorithm to speed up calculations. More
precisely, the EM-algorithm is stopped once the P value is below the
significance level. This can be done because the PC algorithm only needs an
accept/ reject decision.}

\item{m.max}{Maximum size of the conditioning sets.}

\item{res.m.max}{Maximum size of the conditioning set, in the pc-algorithm on
the residuals (used for prior screening).}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, p-values for the conditional independence
tests are printed}

\item{covariates}{A data.frame containing covariates that should always be
used in each conditional independence test. Should be either \code{NULL}
(default) or a data.frame with the same number of rows as \code{suffStat}.
An intercept is already included for each trait in suffStat; covariates
should not contain a column of ones.}

\item{fixedEdges}{A logical matrix of dimension \eqn{(p+1) \times (p+1)},
where \eqn{p} is the number of traits. The first row and column refer to
the genotype node \code{G}, and subsequent rows and columns to the traits.
As in the \code{pcalg} package, the edge \eqn{[i - j]} is never considered
for removal if the entry \eqn{[i, j]} or \eqn{[j, i]} (or both) are
\code{TRUE}. In that case, the edge is guaranteed to be present in the
resulting graph.}

\item{QTLs}{Column numbers in \code{suffStat} that correspond to QTLs. These
may be partly in \eqn{S} and \eqn{x} and \eqn{y}, but \eqn{x} and \eqn{y}
cannot be both QTLs. Note: the factor genotype (column number 1) may occur
in S, as well as x and y}

\item{max.iter}{Maximum number of iterations in the EM-algorithm, used to fit
the bivariate mixed model (when \code{use.res = FALSE)}.}

\item{stop.if.significant}{If \code{TRUE}, the EM-algorithm used in some of
the conditional independence tests (when \code{use.res = FALSE}) will be
stopped whenever the p-value becomes significant, i.e. below \code{alpha}.
This will speed up calculations, and can be done because (1) the PC
algorithm only needs an accept/reject decision (2) In EM the likelihood is
nondecreasing. Should be put to \code{FALSE} if the precise p-values are of
interest.}

\item{cov.method}{A string, specifying which method should be used to compute
the G-BLUP. Options are \code{"us"} (unstructured multi-trait model fitted
using \code{sommer}) and \code{"uni"} (based on univariate GBLUPs).
(Default \code{"uni"})}

\item{use.res}{If \code{FALSE}, residuals from GBLUP are only used for screening with the
standard pc algotihm. After that, the standard pcgen algorithm is run on
the remaining edges; the test for conditional independence of 2 traits
given a set of other traits and G is based on bivariate mixed models. If
\code{TRUE}, this test for conditional independence of 2 traits given a set
of other traits and G is based on the residuals. In this case, no further
edges between traits are removed after screening and \code{pcgen} will only
infer the orientation, and the direct genetic effects.}

\item{return.pvalues}{If \code{TRUE}, the maximal p-value for each edge is
returned.}
}
\value{
If \code{return.pvalues = FALSE}, the output is a graph (an object
with S3 class \code{"pcgen"}). If \code{return.pvalues = TRUE}, the output
is a list with elements \code{gr} (the graph) and \code{pMax} (a matrix
with the p-values).

\description{
pcgen with residual-based screening
}
\details{
The pcgen algorithm starting with a skeleton estimated using the standard
pc-algorithm, based on residuals from the GBLUP.

Here we put a lot of details COMMENT on cov.method (the same option is used
in the computation of the residuals and the conditional means) fixedGaps and
fixedEdges are NULL m.max, alpha,.... are also used in the first step
