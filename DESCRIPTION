Description: Implements the pcgen algorithm, which is a modified version of the standard pc-algorithm,
             with specific conditional independence tests and modified orientation rules. pcgen extends
             the approach of Valente et al. (2010) <doi:10.1534/genetics.109.112979> with reconstruction of 
             direct genetic effects.
